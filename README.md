TestRail2Jira
=============

A tool to convert TestRail test cases to Jira Tickets

Todo
----
* General clean up. The code is cluttered and unorginized
* Move config out to a seperate file
* Better error handling. Right now there is next to none
* Better handling of update runs. Stories should be reopened when new sub-tasks are added to them
* Add support for alternate Jira auth methods
